# About

## Abstract

This repository proposes a model which can generate realistic piano music without human interaction using General Adversarial Network (GAN) proposed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. This model generates piano music of 37 seconds from a latent vector of size 14. It is trained on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackvial/themaestrodatasetv2">MAESTRO V2 dataset </a>. The model is built with `Tensorflow` and completly implemented in `Python`.
